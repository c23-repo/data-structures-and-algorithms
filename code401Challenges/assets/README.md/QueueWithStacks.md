# Challenge Summary
- Create a methods that will work as Queues using two Stacks.
## Challenge Description
- Create two Stacks that will hold the values of your Queue.
- Create two methods, enqueue that takes in a value and dequeue.
- Shift the Queue to the second stack to get rid of the first item that was pushed in.
- return the value of the node that was first added.
## Approach & Efficiency
- The big O is linear and the time space complexity is big O of N.
