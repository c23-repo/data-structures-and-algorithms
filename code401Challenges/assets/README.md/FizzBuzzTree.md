# Challenge Summary
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.

## Challenge Description
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each 
node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:

## Approach & Efficiency
First step is to traverse the tree and check the value of the node. Next step is to check if the value is divisible by
3 and 5. If it is, we set the new value to the String "FizzBuzz", if not we check if it divisible by 3 or 5. If divisible 
by 3, we set the value to "Fizz". If divisible by 5 we set it to "Buzz". If neither is met, we then leave the value as is.
