# Challenge Summary
- Create a methods that will insert a new node to a Linked list and return the node value from a target position from 
the end.
## Challenge Description
- append a value which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.
- insert a value Before which adds a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node.
- insert a value After which adds a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node.
- return the value of a node that is x positions from the end of the Linked List given a target number.
## Approach & Efficiency
- The big O is linear and the time space complexity is big O of N.
