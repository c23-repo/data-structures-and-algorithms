# Hash Table
Code challenge to implement a Hash Table that stores keys and values

## Challenge Description
Implement a HashTable class with the following methods:
- add: takes in a key and value then adds the pair to the hash table; Handle collisions as needed.
- get: takes in a key and returns the value.
- contains: takes in a key and returns a boolean indicating if the key exists in the table.
- hash: takes in a key and returns an index.

## Approach & Efficiency
add, get, and contains all have an O(n) while hash has an O(1).

## API
- add: takes in a key and value then adds the pair to the hash table; Handle collisions as needed.
- get: takes in a key and returns the value.
- contains: takes in a key and returns a boolean indicating if the key exists in the table.
- hash: takes in a key and returns an index.
