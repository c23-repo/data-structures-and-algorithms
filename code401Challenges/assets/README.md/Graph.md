# Graph
This is an implementation of a graph in Java.

## Challenge Description

The Data Structure for the Graph will contain these methods that do the following:

`AddNode`
- Adds a new node to the graph
- Takes in the value of that node
- Returns the added node

`AddEdge`
- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph
- Include the ability to have a “weight”
- Takes in the two nodes to be connected by the edge
- Both nodes should already be in the Graph

`GetNodes`
- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection

`GetNeighbors`
- Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node
- Takes in a given node
- Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection

`Size`
- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph

## Approach and Efficiency
All methods have an O(n)

## API
`AddNode`
- Adds a new node to the graph

`AddEdge`
- Adds a new edge between two nodes in the graph

`GetNodes`
- Returns all of the nodes in the graph as a collection

`GetNeighbors`
- Returns a collection of nodes connected to the given node

`Size`
- Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
