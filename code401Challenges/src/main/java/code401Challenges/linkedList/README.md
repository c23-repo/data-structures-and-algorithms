# Singly Linked List
Create a Linked List

## Challenge
create a linked list and methods that that insert values to an existing list, check if the value already exists and
prints those values for you.

## Approach & Efficiency
First thing was to create the node constructor. Next was to create a method that would create a new node in the list and
and also reassign the head so that it would now track the new node as the next node. Next method was to check if the
node value is already existing. The last method was to print out the nodes that already exist so that we can visualize
them.

## API
Create a new linked list.
Insert a value into head.
Check if a value already exist.
Print out the values of the linked list.
